Hi Federico

 

The Chacon smart light module is now under way to you. ETA some time next week.

 

Pls find attached the fault codes that the PWA needs to be able to receive and display, and here is a link to the datasheet of the fog cannon. You can see it in action here.

 

As we talked about, let’s begin with a page showing a virtual fog cannon with the 5 inputs visible on the outside. These inputs should be able to change status (color) depending on whether they are ‘triggered’ or not.

 

Input 1 (ARM): Arms/disarms the fog cannon. Controlled by PWA and/or alarm system.

Input 2 (Primary): Break-in sensor / alarm system

Input 3 (Secondary): Verifying sensor (room sensor / door switch)

Input 4 (Disable): Disables the fog cannon. Controlled by PWA and/or alarm system.

Input 5 (Fire): Fire sensor. Disables the fog cannon in case of fire.

 

Next to the virtual fog cannon, I suggest that you make a panel with the fault codes. These should be clickable and when clicked, the fault code should appear as an alert/sms in the PWA.

 

If you have any questions, just ping me. The fastest way is via WhatsApp on +45 26 30 18 84.

 

Best,

Torben
